## 5.5.2 Alternative debouncing circuit

# Principle
This circuit uses the same free-running 10 ms clock as the one in the debouncing circuit example. The main difference is that it reacts instantly to the rising/falling edge of the switch. Then it sets/clears the output and waits something between 20 ms and 30 ms to finally confirm the press and move to the one/zero state.

The waiting states are sensible only to the 10 ms tick, so the output is locked by them until the press or depress is confirmed.
